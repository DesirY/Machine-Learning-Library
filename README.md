##README

This is a machine learning library developed by **Xinyuan Yan** for CS5350/6350 in University of Utah

#####Decision Tree
***
* *ID3Alg_2a.py*, *ID3Alg_3a.py*, and *ID3Alg_3b.py* are corrsponded with *2(a)*,*3(a)*, *3(b)* in **Homework 1 Part 2** respectively.
* You can adjust the max depth of the decision tree using variable *max_depth*

####Ensemble Learning
***
**Correspondence**

* 2(a) -- BoostingTrees.py --result1.csv & result2.csv
* 2(b) -- baggedTrees.py --result3.csv
* 2(c) -- baggedTrees2c.py 
* 2(d) -- randomForest.py -- result4.csv
* 2(e) -- randomForest2e.py


####Linear Regression
***
* You can run *LMS.py* for the **batch gradient descent algorithm** and **stochastic gradient descent algorithm**. 
* The variable *batch_r* and *batch_threshould* are used to set *r* and threshold of **batch gradient descent algorithm** respectively.
* The variable *stochastic_r* and *stochastic_threshould* are used to set *r* and threshold of **stochastic gradient descent algorithm** respectively.
* The results of 4(a) and 4(b) are stored in *4a.csv* and *4b.csv* under folder **Results**.
